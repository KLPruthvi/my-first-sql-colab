## Project Overview

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook used for refreshing SQL basics. It demonstrates fundamental SQL operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on a sample sales dataset.

## Data Information

The data used in this project is a small, simulated "Sales Data" set. It is created directly within the Google Colab notebook for demonstration purposes and includes intentional missing values and invalid entries to practice data cleaning with SQL.

**Columns:**
* `OrderID`: Unique identifier for each sale.
* `ProductSold`: Name of the product sold.
* `Quantity`: Number of units sold.
* `PricePerUnit`: Price of one unit.
* `SaleDate`: Date of the sale (format: YYYY-MM-DD).
* `Region`: Geographical region of the sale.

**Note:** This dataset was created for learning purposes and does not originate from an external source like Kaggle, but it mimics real-world data characteristics for practical SQL exercises.
